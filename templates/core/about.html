                                <i>The Carnival of the Animals</i> is a humorous musical suite of fourteen movements
                                by the French Romantic composer Camille Saint-Saëns. <i>The Carnival of the Animals</i>
                                 is supposed to be fun. Each of the suite's 14 movements introduces us
                                to a different animal or group of animals, with a small number of instruments
                                 mimicking their voices or the way they move. Starting with the lion's roar and
                                 slowing to reflect the elephant's bulk, Saint-Saens pokes fun at the music of his time.
                                 The piece has become one of Saint-Saëns's best-known works.

                            something the National Symphony Orchestra does, but it costs way more and is all the way
